##My 1st Portofolio : Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python (https://gist.github.com/AgivPutrayatma) or (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KAxooWas6PZEU_b74MUa0ewh61w-izm0#scrollTo=Vc8sIy6gGh9k)

This is projectd where I analyze smartwatch data that I got from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
1.  81.3% of Total inactive minutes in a day
2.  15.8% of Lightly active minutes in a day
3.  On an average, only 21 minutes (1.74%) were very active
4.  1.11% (13 minutes) of fairly active minutes in a day
5.  Thursday is the most inactive day according to the lifestyle of all the individuals in the dataset.
6.  Tuesday is, therefore, one of the most active days for all individuals in the dataset, as the highest number of calories were burned on Tuesdays.
